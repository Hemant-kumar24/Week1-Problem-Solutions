Min in Sort rotated Array
Imagine you're working on an update system for a fleet of autonomous vehicles at Uber. The
system stores updates in a sorted array for efficiency, but due to unexpected reboots, the array
sometimes gets rotated at a pivot point. Your task is to quickly identify the first version (the
minimum value) after a rotation.
Problem Statement:
Given an array that was initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at an unknown
pivot, write an efficient algorithm to find the minimum element in the array.
‚Ä¢ The array contains no duplicate elements.
‚Ä¢ Your solution must run in O(log N) time.

Input Format:
‚Ä¢ A single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
‚Ä¢ A line containing N space-separated integers, representing the rotated sorted array.
Output Format:
‚Ä¢ Print a single integer ‚Äî the minimum element in the rotated array.
Constraints:
‚Ä¢ 1 <= N <= 10^5
‚Ä¢ -10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
‚Ä¢ No duplicate elements.
‚Ä¢ The array is a rotated version of a sorted array.
Example:
Input:
5
5 7 10 3 4
Output:
3

Explanation:

The original array before rotation might have been [3, 4, 5, 7, 10]. After rotation, it
becomes [5, 7, 10, 3, 4]. The minimum element is 3.
Approach (Binary Search):
‚Ä¢ Initialize low = 0, high = N - 1
‚Ä¢ While low < high:
o Find mid = (low + high) / 2
o If arr[mid] > arr[high], the minimum is in the right half ‚Üí low = mid +
1
o Else, the minimum is in the left half (including mid) ‚Üí high = mid
‚Ä¢ Return arr[low]
‚è± Time Complexity: O(log N)
