Problem Title:
Subarray Sum Equals K
You are working as a data analyst for a fitness app. Every day, users log the number of
calories burned. Your task is to find how many continuous days (subarrays) exist where the
total calories burned equals a certain target k. This helps the app identify specific goal-based
streaks.
Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums representing the calories burned each day, and an integer k
representing a target calorie goal, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose
sum is exactly equal to k.
Input Format:
• An integer n — the number of days.
• An array nums of n integers — calories burned each day.
• An integer k — the target calorie burn.
Output Format:
• A single integer — the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals k.
Constraints:
• 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
• -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
• -10^7 <= k <= 10^7
Example 1:
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 3
Output:
2
Explanation:
There are two subarrays that sum to 3:
• [1, 2]
• [3]

Example 2:
Input:
nums = [1, 1, 1]
k = 2
Output:
2
Explanation:
Subarrays [1,1] at indices (0,1) and (1,2) both sum to 2.

Approach:
✅ Efficient Approach — Prefix Sum + HashMap (Time: O(n), Space: O(n))
1. Use a variable sum to track the running sum.
2. Use a HashMap to store how many times each prefix sum has occurred.
3. For each element:
o Add it to the running sum.
o Check if sum - k is already in the map — if yes, add the count to the result.
o Update the map with the new sum.

Key Insight:
If:
sum(i to j) = sum(j) - sum(i-1)
Then for subarrays ending at j, we check if (sum - k) was seen before.
